/**
 * Registers blocks and stores references to said blocks, if needed. Here I am just storing the
 * blocks in a public static field. Forge also offers the {@link net.minecraftforge.registries.ObjectHolder}
 * annotation to populate fields and make them final. Personally, I do not like this because it
 * creates "field may be null" warnings wherever the field is referenced. The warning is incorrect,
 * but IntelliJ will complain regardless.
 * <p>
 * Another possibility is to use {@link net.minecraft.util.LazyLoadBase}. This initially stores a
 * Supplier, then stores the block after the first access. This is similar to what I do in many
 * cases.
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to design this class as an enum, but that is not always a good idea. I would
 * discourage this if you are new to modding or Java. This is also a bad idea if the number of
 * blocks is large. Check Silent Gear's ModBlocks class for an example if you are curious
 * (https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/blob/1.12/src/main/java/net/silentchaos512/gear/init/ModBlocks.java).
 * <p>
 * If you have a large number of blocks/items with variants, you could use an enum to represent the
 * material, like the Gems enum from Silent's Gems. This enum holds lazy references to all blocks
 * and items made of gems. Considering there are nearly 800 such objects, it makes the code much
 * less tedious! (https://github.com/SilentChaos512/SilentGems/blob/1.13/src/main/java/net/silentchaos512/gems/lib/Gems.java)
